Building Gnote on OSX


Set up jhbuild
--------------
1. Install jhbuild
Follow the installation instructions on https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Building (don't bootstrap jhbuild yet)

2. Setup jhbuild to build gnote
i) Get the gnote build config file
$ curl -o ~/.jhbuildrc-gnote https://raw.github.com/mjfrancis/GnoteOSX/master/osx/jhbuild/jhbuildrc-gnote

ii) The jhbuildrc provided builds for OSX 10.7. Edit it if you are compiling for a different release.

iii) Edit ~/.jhbuildrc-custom and comment out the call to setup_sdk

3. Build gnote
$ JHB=gnote jhbuild bootstrap
$ JHB=gnote jhbuild build gnote

4. Build the OSX application bundle
The raw binary won't do anything much by itself - it needs dbus to be running. To build a working Gnote.app that includes dbus, and all necessary libraries and data:
From within the gnote build directory (~/gnote/<OS RELEASE>/source/GnoteOSX)
$ JHB=gnote jhbuild shell
(jhbuild shell)$ cd osx
(jhbuild shell)$ ./makebundle.sh
