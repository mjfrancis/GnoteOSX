  <title>Note Directory Watcher</title>
    <p>This addin allows you to work with notes on a file system while <app>Gnote</app> is running. When enabled, this addin monitors note files for changes and reloads them, once any change is detected. This way external change to a note file is automatically reflected in <app>Gnote</app>.</p>
    <p><app>Gnote</app> stores notes into <file>~/.local/share/gnote</file> folder. With this addin enabled, you can perform actions at file system level on this directory, such as synchronizing contents with some other location, while <app>Gnote</app> is running.</p>
