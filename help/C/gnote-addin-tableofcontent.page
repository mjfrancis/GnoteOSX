<section id="navigating"><title>Navigating through long notes</title>

<p>
A long note may become difficult to navigate.
It is then natural to structure the note by marking sections and subsections with headers.
</p>

<p>
This add-in makes it easy to navigate through long structured notes.
Once you have set headers in your note, the table of contents of the note will show in a menu.
Then you can jump directly from the menu to any header.
</p>

</section>


<section id="setheaders"><title>Structuring your notes with headers</title>

<p>
A header is simply a complete line with specific text formatting:
</p>
<list>
  <item><p>level 1 headers, for sections, are lines formatted with a <gui>Bold+Huge</gui> font</p></item>
  <item><p>level 2 headers, for subsections, are lines formatted with a <gui>Bold+Large</gui> font</p></item>
</list>


<p>To format a header line, first select a full line of text, then either:</p>

<list>
  <item>
    <p>use the commands <gui>Level 1 Header</gui> and <gui>Level 2 Header</gui>
       in the <guiseq><gui>Tools</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq> menu</p>
  </item>

  <item>
    <p>use the keyboard shortcuts <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>1</key></keyseq> for level 1 headers,
    and <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>2</key></keyseq> for level 2 headers</p>
 </item>
</list>

<p>Alternatively, on a new line, activate a header command and then enter the header title.</p>

<p>You can even use the normal formatting commands from the <gui>Text</gui> menu:
    <gui>Bold</gui>, <gui>Large</gui> and <gui>Huge</gui>, and their respective keyboard shortcuts.
    If, for example, your header line is already formatted as <gui>Huge</gui>, then you just need to make it also <gui>Bold</gui> to turn it into a header of level 1.
    See <link xref="editing-notes"/> to learn how to set text styles.
</p>

</section>


<section id="showtable"><title>Showing the table of contents</title>

<p>You can access the table of contents either:</p>
<list>
<item><p>in the <guiseq><gui>toolbar</gui><gui>Tools</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq> menu</p></item>
<item><p>via <guiseq><gui>context menu</gui><gui>Table of Contents</gui></guiseq> (<keyseq>right-click</keyseq> on the note window)</p></item>
<item><p>in a <gui>popup menu</gui>, with the keyboard shortcut <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Alt</key><key>1</key></keyseq></p></item>
<p>Then you can navigate up and down with the <gui>arrow keys</gui> and jump to the selected header with <key>enter</key>. Or just <keyseq>click</keyseq> with your mouse on the header to jump to.</p>
</list>

<terms>
  <item><title><em style="strong">One header does not show in the table of contents</em></title><p>
    There might be some characters in the header line, such as whitespace characters, which are not formatted as a header. Make sure that <em>the whole line</em> is formatted as a header. See <link xref="#setheaders"/>.</p>
  </item>
  <item><title><em style="strong">There is an empty line in the table of contents</em></title><p>
    An empty line, possibly including whitespace, is formatted as a header. Jump to this line and delete the area.</p>
