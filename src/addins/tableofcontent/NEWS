NEWS for Add-in: Table of Content
=================================

(NOTE: little release manual:
 update NEWS + .desktop version/enabled=false + help topic status/pkgversion ==> commit -m "version x.y")

== 0.11
- fix: use bit-wise operations to test modifier masks (Ctrl/Alt)


== 0.10
- fix: header-2 arrow, 2 chars does not match with some fonts.
       Use a single char one.
- fix: toggling Header 1/2 must preserve other tags.
- new: Ctrl-1/2 toggle header for the complete line(s) (that include the selection)
       (bug #700612)
- fix: language update (s/header/heading/, etc.)

== 0.9
- renamed labels "Level 1 Header" to "Header Level 1" (resp. 2)
- help topic major update
- set help topic status to "candidate"
- updated description in .desktop
- TODO major update from my local notes, see: Todo, Maybe and Maybe not
- code: general code review, various minor updates in code, including:
  - add-in description in copyright headers
  - various code comments
  - renamed header level enum: s/Level/Header/ and s/H1,H2,H3/Title,Level_1,Level_2/
    (so forget the "HTML alike", now Ctrl-1/2 matches Level_1/2 (instead of H2/H3!))
  - renamed get_range_level() into get_header_level_for_range()

== 0.8
